# This file is used by ./godzibox
# Note that many options can be overridden on the command line; try running with
# the --help switch for details of available command line options.

##
## Database Settings
##

# DBHost - Database server "address" or "address:port". Address can be an IP or
#          a hostname. The default MySQL port is 3306 (tcp).
DBHost "192.168.1.240"

# DBUsername - User to connect to the database as.
DBUsername "adminbot"

# DBPassword - Password for the database user.
DBPassword "tDPE69NAwrHNLy"

# DBName - Name of the database to use.
DBName "adminbot"

# DBLowPriority - Use INSERT DELAYED and DELETE LOW_PRIORITY for some queries.
#                 This can give better performance, but may make statistics less
#                 "real time". 1=on 0=off
DBLowPriority 0


##
## UDP Socket Settings (should match "logaddress ip port" on the game servers)
##

# BindIP - IP address to bind to (leave empty to use lo).
BindIP "192.168.1.23"

# Port - Port to listen on for log data from the game servers.
Port 27500


##
## DNS Settings
##

# DNSResolveIP - Resolve player IP addresses to hostnames. Requires a working
#                DNS setup (on the box running godzibox.pl). 1=on 0=off
DNSResolveIP 0

# DNSTimeout - Time in seconds to wait for DNS queries to complete before
#              cancelling. You may need to increase this if on a slow connection
#              or if you find a lot of IPs are not being resolved. However,
#              while godzibox.pl is waiting for an IP to resolve it cannot be
#              parsing log data.
DNSTimeout 5


##
## Rcon Settings
##

# Rcon - Allow godzibox to send Rcon commands to the game servers. 1=on 0=off
Rcon 1

# RconIgnoreSelf - Ignore (do not log) Rcon commands originating from the same
#                  IP as the server being Rcon'd. (Useful if you run any kind of
#                  monitoring script which polls the server regularly by Rcon.)
#                  1=on 0=off
RconIgnoreSelf 0

# RconRecord - Sets whether to record Rcon commands to the Admin event table.
#              This can be useful to see what your admins are doing. But if you
#              run programs like PB it can also fill your database up with a lot
#              of useless junk.
#              1=on 0=off
RconRecord 1


##
## General Settings
##

# MailTo - E-mail address to mail database errors to. (See also MailPath.)
MailTo ""

# MailPath - Path to the 'mail' program -- usually /bin/mail
MailPath "/bin/mail"

# Mode - EXPERIMENTAL: Sets the player-tracking mode.
#        Possible values:
#             Normal     - Recommended for public Internet server use.
#                          Players will be tracked by WON ID.
#             NameTrack  - Useful for shared-PC environments, such as
#                          Internet cafes, etc. Players will be tracked
#                          by nickname. EXPERIMENTAL!
#             LAN        - Useful for LAN servers where players do not
#                          have a real WON ID. Players will be tracked
#                          by IP Address. EXPERIMENTAL!
Mode NameTrack
# NEVER USE "LAN" !!!!

# MinPlayers - Specifies the minimum number of players required in the server
#              for most player events (objectives, frags, etc.) to be recorded.
#              This prevents players from hopping on an empty server and
#              boosting their skill rating by capturing the flag, etc., with no
#              opposition. (Default is 2 players required on the server.)
MinPlayers 2

# UseTimestamp - Set to 0 (the default) to use the current time on the database
#                server for the timestamp when recording events. Set to 1 to use
#                the timestamp provided on the log data. Unless you are
#                processing old log files on STDIN, you probably want to set
#                this to 0; otherwise you will need to ensure that the clocks on
#                your game servers are accurate. 1=on 0=off
UseTimestamp 0

# DebugLevel - Set this to 1 to have debugging information printed on stdout.
#              Set higher for even more debugging information. Set to 0 for
#              quiet operation. It is recommended that you set this to 1 when
#              first configuring godzibox, to help diagnose any problems.
DebugLevel 1
